## Day One
Part one was pretty easy and natural to code, but part two took a bit more work, and I'm not totally
happy with how i ended up doing it. I want to refactor to use a `loop` instead of a `while`.

## Day Two
Part two presented a good opportunity to use the `for` function.

## Day Three
This one ended up giving me a lot more trouble (and time) than I initially anticipated, but I ended up finding a pretty reasonable way to approach it.
